    <h3>A simple login system in Flask</h3>
    <h5>This is in no way what a modern login system should be. It lacks tons of features such as:<br><br>
        <li> Email verification
        </li>
        <li> Password resettng
        </li>
        <li> 2-Factor Authentication
        </li>
    <br>
    This was my very first time using Flask and this is my first experience in web development, so this code is FAR from perfect. I'm sure I overcomplicated most of it.

## How do I use this?

Make sure you have the [requirements](requirements.txt) installed.

Simply run main.py and it will host the website at localhost on port 80.

It'll automatically create the database which uses SQLite.
